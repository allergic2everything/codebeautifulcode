hello :) welcome to this project 

my objective : 
make a program using p5.js references to make basic images based on user input. 
for now, the user SHOULD (keyword : should) be able to 
  1. request a number of basic shapes (ex: "square", "triangle", "circle", "rectangle", "trapezoid", "diamond", or "random polygon with n sides"
  2. adjust color of shapes

those are the main functionalities for now, if i have time i'll add more, but for rn i'm just seeing what i can do with p5 and making my own "ai". 

important note - i used this through the "p5.vscode" extension in vscode. there are libraries in that extension that i didn't include in the files here, but if u install p5 on ur own computer through vs code, you should have them. 

i think that's it. thank you!
